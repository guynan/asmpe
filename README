This started out as a hobby project to learn x86_64 Assembly by solving
familiar Project Euler problems.

It resulted in me leveraging my understanding of the x86_64 architecture
to produce solutions _by hand_ which are generally faster than optimised C.

They are all written from scratch and are all incredibly efficient.
